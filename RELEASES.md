Version 0.103.4 (2024-02-25)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

* Don't automatically position the window off the bottom or the right of the monitor.
* Don't force the window onto the monitor when resizing if it's already placed off the edge.
* Don't let Diablo 2 reposition the cursor when using the mouse wheel on game versions before `1.14`.

Version 0.103.3 (2024-02-21)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix the mouse wheel not working depending on the cursor's position.
* Fix window size limits only taking the primary monitor's resolution into account. Now uses whichever monitor the window is currently on.
* Fix full screen only working on the primary monitor. Now uses whichever monitor the window is currently on.
* Fix the game's window being moved incorrectly when placed on a monitor either above or to the left of the primary monitor.
* Remember the window's position before entering full screen mode rather than always returning to the center of the primary monitor.
* The `position` config in `d2dx.cfg` can now be used to set a negative value to support position left and above the primary monitor. `[-1, -1]` is still used as a special value to mean the center of the primary monitor.

Other
-----

* The `position` config in `d2dx.cfg` now refers to the center of the window, not the top left.

Version 0.103.2 (2024-02-19)
============================

Performance
-----------

* Don't submit draw calls which aren't on the screen. Can be a small, but noticeable improvement.

Bug fixes
---------

* Don't reset the window position on resolution changes when a window position is set in `d2dx.cfg`, but the window has been moved after launch.

Other
-----

* Update d2fps to v1.0.2. Fixes an occasional graphical glitch when rendering rain.

Version 0.103.1 (2024-01-20)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

* Stabilize cursor position changes with non-integer window scale factors. (e.g. weapon switching would 'adjust' the cursor position to the same spot, but d2dx would cause it to drift)
* Fix cursor adjustment positions in windowed mode. (e.g. the cursor would slowly drift when opening and closing panels)

Other
-----

* Update d2fps to v1.0.1. Improves snow rendering and mod compatibility.

Version 0.103.0 (2024-01-08)
============================

New features
------------

* Anti-aliasing support added for versions `1.07`, `1.08`, `1.09a`, `1.09b`, `1.14c`.
* Anti-aliasing now works on inventory items.
* Weather motion smoothing extended to all versions supported by d2fps. With this there is no longer any motion smoothing code left in D2DX.
* Add a new option `noframetearing` to prevent frame tearing even when vsync is disabled. This defaults to `true`
  * To work properly with variable refresh rates this might need to be disabled.

Other
-----

* Switch to a custom Sgd2FreeRes version.
  * Fixes the Arreat Summit background.
  * Improved rendering performance. Can up to double the frame rate.

Version 0.102.1 (2023-11-16)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

Version 0.102.0 (2023-11-14)
============================

New features
------------

* Add motion smoothing to the background of the Arcane Sanctuary.
* Add motion smoothing to missiles.

* Fix compatibility mode sometimes being detected when it's not enabled.

Version 0.101.1 (2023-10-02)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

* Don't move the cursor when it's positioned on the bottom row of the window's pixels.

Version 0.101.0 (2023-10-01)
============================

New features
------------

* Motion smoothing and FPS unlocking has been rewritten and implemented as external module (useable by any other renderer)
  * Perspective mode is notably improved. The distortion it applies based on a unit's position is now recalculated for the unit's displayed position rather than the position from the game's last update.
  * Almost all Diablo II versions are now supported starting from v1.00.
* Resolution mod is now loaded on v1.14c

Changes
-------

* V-sync is disabled by default in favour of a frame limiter. It can be enabled if you really want it. (If you have an old config file it will still be followed)

Bug fixes
---------

* Character animations in the menu no longer run faster than normal.
* CPU use in game and menus with V-sync off has been fixed
* CPU use when the game is minimized has been fixed.
* Text label drift when moving with motion smoothing enabled has been fixed.
* Text label jiggling with motion smoothing enabled has been fixed. (The game still sometimes sucks at ordering item labels and can cause them to be rearranged at a very fast rate when moving)
* Unit cursor detection is now done with the unit's displayed position rather than the position from the game's last update. Note this is a small a effect (a few pixels at most).
* Don't mute the music when reactivating the game's window.

Version 0.100.2 (2023-05-19)
============================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix cursor behaviour when the render area's aspect ratio is not 4x3.
* Fix cursor jumping when opening the left and right panels when the game started in fullscreen and the switched to windowed mode.

Version 0.100.1 (2023-05-08)
============================

------------

* Don't let the game minimize when the window selection changes

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix cursor locking area in window mode when the render area is smaller than the window size.
* Don't make the window wider than it needs to be when the monitor's height is exceeded.

Version 0.100.0 (2023-04-09)
============================

New features
------------

* Two new upscaling methods:
  * `Nearest Neighbour`: Uses the closest matching pixel. Looks sharp and pixilated.
  * `Rasterize`: Rasterizes the game at the target resolution. Slightly better pixel selection while still looking relatively sharp. Helps with perspective mode.
* Bilinear filtering when rendering textures. This is requested by the game when rendering most ground textures, but used to be ignored. This is especially helpful in perspective mode when the ground textures get distorted.
* New `bilinear-sharpness` configuration option to control how sharp the filtering of the new bilinear texture filter should be. Higher values will render closer to the old version.
* Display cutscenes using the full size of the window instead of being boxed into a 4x3 area.
* Add `nokeepaspectratio` option to stretch the game to the window.
* Update `SGD2FreeRes` to version `3.0.3.1`. This adds support for `v1.10` and `v1.12a`; and fixes the issue with black tiles appearing around the border of the screen.
* Implement full motion prediction for `v1.10`.
* Implement text motion prediction for `v1.09` and `v1.12`.

Version 0.99.415
================

* Add fps fix that greatly smoothes out frame pacing and mouse cursor movement. Can be disabled with -dxnofpsfix.
* Improve color precision a bit on devices that support 10 bits per channel (this is not HDR, just reduces precision loss from in-game lighting/gamma).
* To improve bug reports, a log file (d2dx_log.txt) will be written to the Diablo II folder.

Version 0.99.414
================

* The mouse cursor is now confined to the game window by default. Disable with -dxnoclipcursor.
* Finish AA implementation, giving improved quality.
* Reverted behavior: the mouse cursor will now "jump" when opening inventory like in the unmodded game. This avoids the character suddenly changing movement direction if holding LMB while opening the inventory.

Version 0.99.410
================

* Improved non-integer scaling quality, using "anti-aliased nearest" sampling (similar to sharp-bilinear).
* Specifying -dxnowide will now select a custom screen mode that gives integer scaling, but with ~4:3 aspect ratio.
* Added -dxnoresmod option, which turns off the built-in SlashDiablo-HD (no custom resolutions).
* (For res mod authors) Tuned configurator API to disable the built-in SlashDiablo-HD automatically when used.
* Other internal improvements.

Version 0.99.408
================

* Fix window size being squashed vertically after alt-entering from fullscreen mode.
* Fix crash when running on Windows 7.

Version 0.99.407
================

* For widescreen mode, select 720p rather than 480p in-game resolution on 1440p monitors.

Version 0.99.406
================

* Fix bug that could crash the game in the Video Options menu.

Version 0.99.405
